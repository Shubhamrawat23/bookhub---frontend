# State Management

Zustand is used for lightweight global state management.

Features handled through Zustand:

- Author session persistence
- Admin session persistence
- Ticket state handling
- LocalStorage persistence

---

# Routing System

React Router DOM is used for frontend routing.

Examples:

```text
/author/login
/admin/login
/author/books
/author/tickets
/admin/query-tickets
```

---

# Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside frontend root.

Example:

```env
VITE_BASE_URL=https://bookhub-back-end-production.up.railway.app
```

---

# Install Dependencies

Install frontend packages:

```bash
npm install
```

---

# Package Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.3.0",
    "react": "^19.2.6",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.6",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.15.1",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.3.0",
    "zustand": "^5.0.13"
  }
}
```

---

# Run Frontend Locally

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# Build Frontend

```bash
npm run build
```

---

# Lint Frontend

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

# Backend Integration

The frontend integrates with FastAPI backend APIs hosted on Railway.

Features integrated:

- Authentication APIs
- Books APIs
- Ticket APIs
- Admin APIs

---

# Session Handling

Current implementation uses:

- Zustand store
- LocalStorage persistence

This allows:

- Persistent login sessions
- Role-based frontend access
- Session restore after refresh

---

# API Communication

The frontend communicates using Fetch API.

Examples:

```text
POST /auth/author/login
GET /author/book/list
POST /ticket/create
GET /ticket/author/list
```

---

# UI/UX Decisions

- Minimal clean dashboard design
- Responsive layouts
- Reusable component structure
- Lightweight state management
- Fast page navigation using React Router

---

# CORS Handling

CORS configuration handled between:

- Vercel frontend
- Railway backend

to allow secure frontend-backend communication.

---

# Known Limitations

- JWT authentication not implemented yet
- Polling used instead of WebSockets
- Basic session persistence

---

# Future Improvements

- JWT authentication
- Protected route middleware
- AI-assisted ticket categorization

---

# Design Decisions

- React chosen for component reusability
- Vite used for fast development/build performance
- Zustand selected for lightweight global state
- TailwindCSS used for rapid UI development
- React Router DOM used for SPA routing

---

# Tradeoffs

- Polling used instead of WebSockets for assignment simplicity
- Focused on core functionality over heavy animations
- Lightweight authentication/session system used for MVP scope

---

# Production Improvements

If evolving this project further into production:

- JWT refresh token flow
- RBAC authorization
- AI-assisted ticket categorization
